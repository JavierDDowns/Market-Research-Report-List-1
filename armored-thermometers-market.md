<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Armored Thermometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mercury-filled Armored ThermometersÂ </li><li>Non-Mercury Armored Thermometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The armored thermometer market is divided into two main types: mercury-filled and non-mercury armored thermometers. Mercury-filled armored thermometers utilize mercury as the temperature-sensing fluid, providing accurate readings but raising safety concerns due to potential mercury exposure. In contrast, non-mercury armored thermometers use alternative fluids, such as alcohol or digital sensors, eliminating the risks associated with mercury while still delivering reliable temperature measurements. Both types are designed with protective housings to enhance durability and resistance to extreme conditions.</p></p>
