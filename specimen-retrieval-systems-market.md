<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval systems are vital in minimally invasive surgeries to collect tissue samples safely. The market is divided into two types: detachable and non-detachable systems. Detachable retrieval systems allow surgeons to separate the specimen from the retrieval device after collection, enhancing flexibility and ease of handling. In contrast, non-detachable systems keep the specimen attached during retrieval, which can simplify the process but may limit maneuverability. Both types serve critical roles in aiding effective surgical outcomes and specimen management.</p></p>
